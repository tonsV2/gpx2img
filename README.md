# Gpx2img
Some years ago I went to Nepal for hiking. I tracked my treks using Endomondo and took photos using a Nikon D7000 camera.

The D7000 doesn't have a GPS chip so in order to add GPS data to my photos I made this script.

# Disclaimer
The code is hideous! I didn't make this to be a text book example.

# Setup
```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --editable .
```

# Usage
Update the variables at the top of `gpx2img.py` to fit your needs and then run `gpx2img`.
